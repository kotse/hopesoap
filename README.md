### How to run ###

1. You have to install the following:
 - npm and node.js
 - grunt (`npm install -g grunt`)
 - http-server (`npm install -g http-server`) 

2. Navigate to the project's root and execute:
  ```
  > npm install
  > grunt
  ```
3. In different console navigate to the project's root and run the HTTP server:
  ```
  > npm start
  or
  > http-server
  ```
4. You can now go to http:/localhost:8080 and check if it is working.
