### How to run ###

1. You have to install the following:
 - npm and node.js
 - grunt (`npm install -g grunt`)
 - http-server (`npm install -g http-server`) 

2. Navigate to the project's root and execute:
  ```
  > npm install
  > grunt
  ```
3. In different console navigate to the project's root and run the HTTP server:
  ```
  
  > http-server
  ```
4. You can now go to http:/localhost:8080 and check if it is working.


### TODO ###

1) Make it a proper node project, not just a bunch of html/css

2) Clean up less/css (in progress - Kotse, ongoing)

3) Add admin page

4) Figure out a way to upload images

5) Resize all images (main background on the first "page", also for the catalog after)

6) Finish catalog design (partially completed, still in progress - Kotse)

7) Add a cart functionality to the catalog

8) Integrate catalog in the website in a better way

9) Push ot heroku for demo purposes
